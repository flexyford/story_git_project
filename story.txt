[5] Mrs Pennington came to the front porch. "Tommy, I have your jacket. Please put it on."


[14] Tommy saw the fence that surrounded the city dump. He was happy to be with his friend. They would have fun in the dump.

	Suddenly, a car pulled up. It was Tommy’s mom. Mrs. Pennington wasn’t about to let her little boy run into the city dump.


[?] "Where do you think we are going?" Tommy asked the lead.

    "Does it matter?" the leaf replied. "Have fun. Life is short."

    "I beg to differ," an older leaf said suddently coming beside them. "The journey may be short, but the end is the beginning."

    Tommy pondered this the best a leaf ould ponder.

    "Where do we end up?"
