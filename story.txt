[?]  A maple leaf came close-by, touched him and moved ahead. Tommy met him shortly, brushed against him, and moved further ahead. They swirled around and around, hit cars and poles, flew up into the air and then down again.

"This is fun," Tommy thought.

[3]  Tommy crawled down from the window-seat and ran to the door. He opened it with a bang. The wind blew fiercely and snatched the newly recovered mail from Mrs. Pennington's hands and blew it even further into the house.

"Oh my," she said again. Tommy ran outside and the door slammed shut.

Outside, yellow, gold, and red leaves were leaping from swaying trees, landing on the roof, jumping off the roof, and then chasing one another down the street in tiny whirlwinds of merriment.

[5] Mrs Pennington came to the front porch. "Tommy, I have your jacket. Please put it on."

[?] "Where do you think we are going?" Tommy asked the lead.

    "Does it matter?" the leaf replied. "Have fun. Life is short."

    "I beg to differ," an older leaf said suddently coming beside them. "The journey may be short, but the end is the beginning."

    Tommy pondered this the best a leaf could ponder.

    "Where do we end up?"
